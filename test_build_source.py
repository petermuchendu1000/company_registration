"""Stage 5 must build from the same store as every other stage.

    python3 test_build_source.py

Hermetic: the database is stubbed, no workbook is read unless a test asks
for one.

apps/generator/catalog.load_companies used to default to
pipeline_output/companies_pipeline.xlsx. Nothing writes that sheet from the
database - db.py's CLI has only --diff and --import, both Excel to
database, and there is no export - so the app build and the rest of the
pipeline read two different stores. On a server where the sheet had never
been produced, stage 5 raised FileNotFoundError. The worse case is the
quiet one: where an OLD sheet exists, stage 5 would build a stale set of
companies while every other stage used the database, and nothing would say
so.

The sheet is still readable when a caller explicitly asks for one, because
the standalone tools work that way. None of the three in-repo callers does.
