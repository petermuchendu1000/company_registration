"""Only companies with a Kenyan director may enter the pipeline.

    python3 test_kenyan_filter.py

Hermetic: no network, no database. The officer records below are real ones
captured from the live Companies House API, so the rule is exercised
against what the data actually looks like rather than what it ought to.

Why the rule costs what it does. /search/companies carries NO officer data
at all - measured, its item keys are address, address_snippet,
company_number, company_status, company_type, date_of_creation,
description, description_identifier, kind, links, matches, snippet, title -
and /advanced-search/companies silently IGNORES a nationality parameter
(hits came back 20075 with `nationality`, `officer_nationality`,
`director_nationality`, and with none). Nationality exists only on
/company/{cn}/officers, so each candidate costs one extra request against a
budget of 600 per 5 minutes.

The rule: admit iff at least one ACTIVE DIRECTOR is Kenyan AND no active
director's nationality is unrecorded. Both halves were chosen against real
cases, which are the fixtures below.
