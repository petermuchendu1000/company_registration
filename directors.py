"""Reading Companies House officer records.

One copy, imported by both the console (api_v2) and the pipeline
(run_pipeline), because the console filters a search on these rules and the
pipeline writes a row from them. This project has twice paid for the same
logic living in two places - two domain scorers that disagreed about which
company a domain spelled, and two output paths that disagreed about where
an app was written - so the selection rule gets one home.

Pure: standard library only, no network, no database, no configuration.

    Separate from kenyan_directors because the two callers hold different

    dossier has details["directors"], which get_company_details has already
    reduced to active directors and which carries only name, nationality
    and appointed_on - no officer_role at all. Running the role filter over
    that list would discard every entry and name nobody.

    The ORDER is why this is a function rather than a comprehension at two
    call sites. The row's director columns are single-valued, so which
    Kenyan director they describe has to be the same answer everywhere, and
    must not depend on the order the API happened to return - KENYA AIRWAYS
    PLC has three active Kenyan directors among five.

    A missing appointed_on sorts last, not first, so a dated appointment
    always wins over an undated one.

    The name breaks a tie, because the date alone does not. Measured on
    FC010541: ELEVEN active Kenyan directors, every one appointed
    1980-07-11. Python's sort is stable, so on the date alone the winner
    would be whichever one Companies House happened to list first - and
    the API promises no order, so the same company could name a different
    director from one request to the next, and the row would describe
    someone the ID stage never produces.
