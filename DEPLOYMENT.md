# Deployment runbook

Every figure here was measured or read from an API in the session that
produced this file. Where something is unverified it says so, rather than
reading as fact.

## What I could not do

I could not create the server. No Vultr credential exists in the build
environment, no provisioning CLI is installed, and `api.vultr.com/v2/account`
answers `401`. Creating it also needs the payment method on the account.

A write-scoped API token would be a larger grant than a three-minute console
operation justifies, so **create the instance yourself** and run this runbook
on it.

## 1. The instance

Read from `api.vultr.com/v2/plans` [VERIFIED]:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| plan | `vhf-2c-4gb` (High Frequency) |
| price | $24/month |
| vCPU | 2 |
| RAM | 4096 MB |
| disk | 128 GB NVMe |
| bandwidth | 3072 GB |
| region | `lhr` (London) — confirmed available for this plan |

### As provisioned [VERIFIED on the live instance]

| field | observed |
|---|---|
| hostname | `company-registration` |
| IPv4 | `95.179.203.236` |
| IPv6 | `2a05:f480:1000:0170:5400:06ff:fef5:25ad` (`/64` prefix) |
| rDNS | `95.179.203.236.vultrusercontent.com` (Vultr default) |
| ASN | `AS20473 The Constant Company, LLC` |
| OS | `Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)`, kernel `6.1.0-53-amd64` |
| OpenSSH | `9.2p1 Debian-2+deb12u10` |
| CPU / RAM | 2 vCPU / 3909 MB (363 MB used at idle) |
| disk | `/dev/vda2`, 120 G usable, 104 G free |
| swap | `/swapfile`, 8 G, active, prio -2 — shipped by the image |
| listening | `sshd` on `:22` only (v4 + v6) |

Custom reverse DNS is available in the Vultr panel but was deliberately
skipped: anti-bot systems key on ASN, which a PTR edit cannot change, and
pointing the PTR at a domain you own ties the box to your registrations
without removing the signal that matters.

The cheapest plan that fits is `vc2-2c-2gb` at $15 (2 vCPU, 2048 MB, 65 GB
SSD). It works on the measurements below, with roughly 600 MB spare. This
deployment took the 4 GB plan instead, which turns that margin from
"adequate" into "not something to think about".

OS: **Debian 12 (bookworm)**, deliberately, and do not casually move to 13.
The code itself is fine on either — no `match` statements, no `except*`,
and 18 files carry `from __future__ import annotations`, so Debian 12's
Python 3.11 is sufficient. [INFERRED from those greps; only 3.13 is
[VERIFIED], being what the build environment ran.]

The reason to stay on 12 is step 3. Playwright lists Debian 13 as
supported from 1.55, but there is an open bug in which
`playwright install --with-deps` on Debian 13 misidentifies the OS as
Ubuntu and installs the Ubuntu 20.04 dependency set instead
(microsoft/playwright#38689, playwright-python#2950). That command feeds
the headed-browser path, which is already the least verifiable part of
this system. Debian 12 removes the variable at no cost.

**London, not Johannesburg**, even though you are in Nairobi. The server
talks to Companies House, Namecheap and D&B far more than you click, and a
dashboard does not care about 140 ms. A UK-origin IP is also the least
anomalous source for UK company lookups.

### Why 2 vCPU, and why the memory headroom matters

Measured in the build environment:

| | peak RSS |
|---|---|
| headless Chromium | 742 MB |
| **headed Chromium + Xvfb** | **1117 MB** |
| gunicorn master + worker | 75 MB |

Budget: 1117 + 75 + 363 (Debian at idle, [VERIFIED] by `free -m` on the
live box) ≈ **1.6 GB**. On the 2 GB plan that would have left ~400 MB,
which is tight enough that swap would have been part of the working set;
on 4 GB it leaves ~2.3 GB, and the image's 8 GB swap stays a safety net.
This is the measurement that justifies the upgrade to 4 GB.

The second core is not optional either way. Headed Chromium under Xvfb is
CPU-bound while rendering, and on a single core it contends with the
process serving the dashboard — so a DUNS run would make the UI crawl
exactly when you want to watch it.

Swap needs no action: the Vultr Debian 12 image already provides 8 GB at
`/swapfile`, active, prio -2 ([VERIFIED] on the live box). Step 2 only
verifies it — it does not create it.

## 2. Base setup

### 2a. Wait for first-boot provisioning

```bash
cloud-init status        # must print exactly: status: done
```

cloud-init runs its own `apt` operations on first boot. Installing
packages while it holds `/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend` gives either a lock
error (harmless) or a half-configured package state (not). If it reports
`running`, bound the wait rather than blocking indefinitely:

```bash
timeout 180 cloud-init status --wait; echo "exit=$?"   # 124 = still busy
```

Plain `cloud-init status --wait` blocks forever with no timeout. It looks
like a hung terminal. It is not — but use the bounded form.

### 2b. Verify swap — do not create it

```bash
swapon --show    # expect: /swapfile  file  8G  0B  -2
free -h
```

The Vultr Debian 12 image ALREADY ships an active 8 GB `/swapfile`.
Running `fallocate -l 2G /swapfile` against a swapfile the kernel is
paging to truncates it in place and can take the box down. Only if
`swapon --show` prints nothing:

```bash
# fallocate -l 2G /swapfile && chmod 600 /swapfile && mkswap /swapfile
# swapon /swapfile
# echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
```

### 2c. Close the root password surface

The image ships `PasswordAuthentication yes` and `PermitRootLogin yes`,
so root is brute-forceable from the public internet. Port 22 is the only
open port and is scanned continuously.

Do not start this until a key login is proven working. Keep the current
session open throughout — it is the rollback path.

```bash
cat > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01-hardening.conf <<'EOF'
# Must sort before 50-cloud-init.conf: sshd takes the FIRST value it
# obtains, so this file has to be read first to beat PasswordAuthentication yes.
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
EOF
chmod 600 /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01-hardening.conf

sshd -t; echo "sshd -t exit=$?"
sshd -T | grep -E "^(permitrootlogin|passwordauthentication) "
```

Both checks read from disk and leave the running daemon untouched, so a
mistake here costs nothing. Expected:

```
sshd -t exit=0
permitrootlogin without-password
passwordauthentication no
```

**Trap 1 — the filename is load-bearing.** sshd takes the *first* value
it obtains, and `sshd_config.d/*.conf` is globbed in lexical order. The
image ships `50-cloud-init.conf` containing `PasswordAuthentication yes`.
A conventionally-named `99-hardening.conf` is read second, loses, and
changes nothing — while `systemctl reload` reports success and the file
sits on disk looking correct. `01-` wins. It also beats `PermitRootLogin
yes` at line 123 of the main config, because the `Include` is at line 12.

**Trap 2 — `without-password` is the correct output.** On OpenSSH 9.2p1
(Debian 12) `without-password` and `prohibit-password` both map to
`PERMIT_NO_PASSWD`, and `sshd -T` prints whichever appears first in
`multistate_permitrootlogin[]` — in 9.2p1, the deprecated spelling.
sshd_config(5): "set to `prohibit-password` (or its deprecated alias,
`without-password`), password and keyboard-interactive authentication are
disabled for root." Current OpenSSH reversed the table order, so this
line will read `prohibit-password` after a future upgrade. Cosmetic.

Only if both checks pass:

```bash
systemctl reload ssh && systemctl is-active ssh
```

`reload` sends SIGHUP; existing connections survive.

Then prove it bites. **On your workstation, in a new terminal**, with the
server session still open:

```bash
hostname                                  # must NOT be the server
ssh root@<ip> echo A_OK                   # must print A_OK
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no \
    root@<ip> true; echo "exit=$?"        # must be 255, and the error
                                          # must read (publickey) ONLY
```

These must run on the workstation. The server holds only the *public*
key, so it fails both tests from itself no matter how sshd is configured
— a failure there proves nothing about lockout. `(publickey)` alone in
the error is sshd enumerating the methods it still offers; if password
auth were live it would read `(publickey,password)`.

Rollback, from the still-open session:

```bash
rm /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/01-hardening.conf && systemctl reload ssh
```

The Vultr noVNC console attaches below the network stack and works even
if sshd is wedged, so lockout is recoverable in all cases.

### 2d. Packages

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip git curl xvfb
```

## 3. Application

### 3a. Clone

If the repository is private, capture the token with `read` so it never
reaches shell history or the screen. Paste this line **alone** — `read`
consumes the next line of input, so inside a pasted block it would
swallow the following command as the token:

```bash
unset HISTFILE; while :; do read -rsp 'Paste PAT then press Enter: ' GH_PAT; echo; [ -n "$GH_PAT" ] && break; echo "empty, try again"; done; export GH_PAT; echo "captured ${#GH_PAT} chars"
```

A fine-grained PAT is 93 characters; any other count means a truncated
paste. The loop re-prompts on an empty read, which happens when the
paste carries a trailing newline that `read` consumes immediately.

```bash
git clone -b claude/upbeat-newton-6u6jwz \
  "https://${GH_PAT}@github.com/petermuchendu1000/gglabs.git" \
  /opt/company_registration
cd /opt/company_registration

# git clone writes the credentialed URL into .git/config verbatim, leaving
# a plaintext token on disk permanently. Overwrite it and PROVE it is gone.
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/petermuchendu1000/gglabs.git
grep -c github_pat .git/config || true     # MUST print 0
unset GH_PAT                               # keep it out of child processes
```

`-b` makes the clone fail loudly if the branch is missing, rather than
silently landing on an unhardened default branch. Verify with
`git log --oneline -1` that HEAD is the commit you expect.

### 3b. Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.lock.txt
```

**Install from `requirements.lock.txt`, not `requirements.txt`.**
`requirements.txt` carries no version constraints at all, so it resolves
to whatever is newest on the day it runs. The lock file pins the set the
test suite actually passed against. The pin that matters most is
`playwright-stealth==2.0.3`: `browser_stealth.py` uses the v2 API
(`Stealth`, `apply_stealth_async`), and v1 had neither, so an unpinned
resolve to v1 is an ImportError that kills the DUNS stage.

No compiler is required. `psycopg2-binary` and `Pillow` both ship cp311
manylinux x86_64 wheels; all other pins are pure Python. Verified by
parsing platform tags from PyPI rather than by assumption.

### 3c. Browser

```bash
.venv/bin/playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Installs Chromium **and** its system libraries. `--with-deps` is the
documented flag for the OS packages; `chromium` pulls the full browser,
which the DUNS path needs because it runs headed. This is the step that
breaks on Debian 13 (microsoft/playwright#38689) and is the reason the
base image is Debian 12.

### 3d. Service account

Must come AFTER 3c: it copies the browsers that step just downloaded.

The app shells out to `run_pipeline`, drives a browser and accepts file
uploads. Any of those going wrong as root is a different incident from the
same thing going wrong as an unprivileged user, so it does not run as root.

```bash
useradd --system --home-dir /opt/company_registration \
        --shell /usr/sbin/nologin pipeline 2>/dev/null || true

# Playwright downloaded its browsers into ROOT's cache in 3c, where the
# service user cannot read them.
mkdir -p /opt/ms-playwright
cp -a /root/.cache/ms-playwright/. /opt/ms-playwright/

chown -R pipeline:pipeline /opt/company_registration /opt/ms-playwright
chmod 600 /opt/company_registration/.env
```

The unit sets `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/ms-playwright` to match.

## 4. Environment file

`/opt/company_registration/.env`, mode `600`. Every name below was read out
of the source, not guessed:

```ini
# Required, or the app serves nothing but /health. Generate with:
#   python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
APP_AUTH_TOKEN=
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=

DATABASE_URL=            # Supabase SHARED POOLER url - see below. Not the
                         # direct db.<ref>.supabase.co host, which will not
                         # resolve on this server. SUPABASE_DB_URL also read.
COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY=

NAMECHEAP_API_USER=
NAMECHEAP_API_KEY=
NAMECHEAP_USERNAME=
NAMECHEAP_CLIENT_IP=     # see step 5 - MUST be this server's IP
NAMECHEAP_SANDBOX=1      # keep 1 until you have deliberately tested live
NAMECHEAP_DEFAULT_ADDRESS_ID=
NAMECHEAP_REFERENCE_DOMAIN=

XBINDER_EMAIL=
XBINDER_PASSWORD=

LOG_LEVEL=INFO           # INFO switches on browser_stealth's diagnostics
DB_POOL_MAX=16           # must exceed gunicorn threads (8) plus stage threads
```

`NAMECHEAP_SANDBOX=1` deliberately. Domain registration spends money; turn
it off only when you intend a real purchase.

### Direct host works here — the pooler is the fallback

An earlier version of this runbook said the direct host would not resolve
on this server and mandated the pooler. **That was wrong, and the live box
disproved it.** `deploy_check.py` connects over
`db.ufsiqqsycywnplttvxbz.supabase.co:5432` and reports
`PostgreSQL 17.11 on aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

What is true: that hostname is **IPv6-only**. A DoH query returns AAAA
records and no A record at all, with a nonsense sibling returning NXDOMAIN
as a control, so it is a real and specific absence rather than a resolver
artifact. Vultr gives this instance a working IPv6 address
(`2a05:f480:1000:0170:…`), so the direct connection succeeds.

Direct is also the better shape here when IPv6 works: no pooler hop, full
Postgres feature support, and `db._pool()` already maintains its own
`ThreadedConnectionPool` (max 16, `db.py:119`) — a transaction pooler
underneath an application pool is pooling a pool.

**Use the pooler only if IPv6 egress is unavailable**, which
`deploy_check.py` will show as a `Network is unreachable` or a timeout in
section 6 rather than a successful `connects:` line. Two differences from
direct string matter, and the second is easy to miss:

```
postgresql://postgres.<project-ref>:<password>@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
             username becomes postgres.<ref>,     pooler host, and the region
             NOT plain postgres                   is not guessable - copy it
```

If you do need it, use **port 5432 (session mode)**, not 6543 (transaction
mode). Session mode keeps one backend per client connection, which is what
`db._pool()` expects; transaction mode also drops prepared statements.

Copy the exact string from the Supabase dashboard: Project Settings →
Database → Connection string → **Session pooler**. The region index in the
hostname varies by project and cannot be guessed.

Keep an eye on `DB_POOL_MAX` against your plan's connection limit: session
mode holds one backend per pooled connection, so 16 here means up to 16
backends held by this app.

## 5. Namecheap IP allowlist — do this before any domain stage

The Namecheap API rejects calls from an un-allowlisted IP, and the new
server has a different IP from your laptop.

```bash
cd /opt/company_registration
.venv/bin/python check_ip.py     # reports this host's public IP and whether
                                 # Namecheap accepts it, and rewrites
                                 # NAMECHEAP_CLIENT_IP in .env
```
Then add that IP at Namecheap: Profile → Tools → API Access → Manage.

Skipping this does not fail quietly in a harmless way — the domain stage
will error, and with the purchase-claim machinery in place it will leave the
company's `domain_status` needing a manual look.

## 6. Display for the DUNS browser path

The dashboard's own DUNS stage needs **no** display: it goes through
`run_pipeline.get_duns_number`, which is a plain HTTP call to D&B's JSON
endpoint. The **wizard's** DUNS button (`POST /api/duns/request`) and the
stealth endpoints in `app.py` drive a real browser, forced headed because
D&B blocks headless.

Two units rather than wrapping gunicorn in `xvfb-run`: a long-running daemon
under `xvfb-run` complicates signal handling and restarts, and a standalone
Xvfb gives the app a stable `DISPLAY` across restarts.

Both units are versioned in `deploy/`, so they are reviewed in the repo
rather than pasted into a terminal from a chat window:

```bash
cd /opt/company_registration
install -m 644 deploy/xvfb.service deploy/company-registration.service \
        /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now xvfb company-registration
systemctl --no-pager status xvfb company-registration
```

Two details in those files are deliberate and easy to undo by accident:

**They run as `pipeline`, not root** (step 3d), and set
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/ms-playwright` because Playwright downloaded
its browsers into root's cache.

**Neither uses `EnvironmentFile`.** The app already loads `.env` through
python-dotenv (`app.py:14`, `db.py:37`) and `WorkingDirectory` puts it in
reach. Handing the same file to systemd as well would mean the database
password had to survive systemd's `EnvironmentFile` parsing, which is not
shell quoting — an unquoted value runs to end of line, and characters that
are harmless to dotenv change what systemd reads. One parser, one file.

**Neither sets `PrivateTmp`.** Xvfb's socket lives in `/tmp/.X11-unix` and
both units must see the same one; a private `/tmp` gives each its own and
the browser finds no display.

`workers = 1` in `gunicorn.conf.py` is a correctness constraint, not tuning:
the job table lives in process memory. Do not raise it.

**Do not run `python app.py` while the service is up.** Its `__main__`
loops over ten ports, so it will not refuse to start — it binds a different
one and you end up with two app processes. `duns_requests.json` is now
guarded by an `fcntl.flock` on a `duns_requests.json.lock` sidecar, so the
two cannot corrupt the store or lose each other's records, but the second
process still has its own in-memory job table and the dashboard will
disagree with itself about what is running. Use `systemctl stop company-registration`
first.

If a DUNS operation ever fails with "could not lock
duns_requests.json.lock", that is this situation: something else holds the
lock. Find the second process. The lock is released by the kernel when a
process exits, so a crash cannot leave it stuck.

## 7. Public HTTPS with Caddy

`gunicorn.conf.py` binds `127.0.0.1:8000` on purpose: the app is never
directly reachable, and Caddy is the only thing listening publicly.

**This is a deliberate trade, made explicitly.** An earlier version of this
runbook put the console behind Tailscale and said not to expose it. That is
the stronger posture and it is the right one for a single technical
operator. It was dropped because the console is used by someone who is not
technical, and Tailscale means installing software and signing in on every
device they might use. A public URL with HTTPS, a login page and a
rate-limited password is the weaker posture; it is chosen knowingly, not by
omission. If the operator ever becomes technical, Tailscale is strictly
better and this section should be reverted.

What carries the weight instead: TLS on every byte, `auth.py`'s login
limiter (8 failures per 5 minutes per client), a session cookie that stores
only a fingerprint of the token, and gunicorn never being reachable except
through the proxy.

### Install

```bash
apt install --yes debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' \
  | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' \
  | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
chmod o+r /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg \
          /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
apt update && apt install -y caddy
```

Installing the package starts Caddy as a systemd service automatically.

Caddy rather than nginx + certbot because it obtains and renews
certificates by itself, with no cron job and no manual renewal step. For
something that must keep working unattended, that outweighs nginx being
more familiar.

### Configure

```bash
cd /opt/company_registration
cp deploy/Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
# Edit the hostname at the top if it is not gglabs.tukaze.com
caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile   # must pass BEFORE reloading
systemctl reload caddy
```

`caddy validate` parses the file without touching the running server, so a
typo is caught while the old config is still serving.

### Prerequisites, in order

1. A DNS **A record** for the hostname pointing at this server, confirmed
   resolving before Caddy starts. Let's Encrypt validates by connecting to
   that name; if it does not resolve yet, issuance fails and Caddy retries
   with a backoff.
2. **Ports 80 and 443 reachable from the internet.** 80 is not optional
   even though the site is HTTPS — it carries the ACME HTTP-01 challenge
   and the redirect to HTTPS.
3. Let's Encrypt will **not** issue for a bare IP address. Without a
   hostname the only option is plaintext HTTP, with the password crossing
   the internet in the clear.

### HSTS starts short on purpose

`deploy/Caddyfile` sets `Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=300"`. Once a
browser sees that header it refuses plain HTTP for the host for max-age
seconds and there is no way to call it back early. Five minutes is enough
to prove the header is served while leaving an HTTP fallback if issuance
turns out to be broken. Raise it to `31536000` once the site is confirmed
working over HTTPS — the commented line is already in the file.

## 8. Database schema

First start runs `ensure_schema`, which now reconciles columns with
`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`. It will **add `short_name` to
your live Supabase table.** Additive, nullable, metadata-only in Postgres —
no table rewrite. Rollback is `DROP COLUMN short_name`.

## 9. The spreadsheet import

Both UIs now read Postgres, so **any company that exists only in your Excel
file will not appear** until it is imported.

`import_from_excel` was **not safe to run** as originally written, and this
was measured, not suspected. It included a column whenever the HEADER was
present, whatever the cell held, and `_norm` maps `""` to `None`, so every
blank cell wrote NULL over a live value. Against a sheet with blank domain
columns:

```
domain_status  'purchasing'       -> None    (purchase claim destroyed)
domain         'alreadybought.uk' -> None    (owned domain erased)
then: claim_domain_purchase() -> True        (a second billed order allowed)
      _compute_stages domain   -> False      (run-all would buy again)
```

It now skips blank cells, so an import can add rows and fill gaps but never
erase. **A populated cell still overwrites a populated column** — that is
what an import is for — so the sheet must be right about anything it does
fill in.

### First, verify the live schema

```bash
cd /opt/company_registration
.venv/bin/python db.py --verify        # read-only; exits non-zero on a mismatch
```

This is the check that cannot be done anywhere but against the real
database: whether the live table matches `db.COLUMNS`, how many companies
there are, and — printed last and loudly — whether any company holds an
outstanding `'purchasing'` claim. A claim means a domain may already have
been bought and charged without its outcome being recorded; reconcile it
against Namecheap before running the domain stage for that company again.

`--verify` and `--diff` deliberately do **not** run `ensure_schema`, so
neither can alter the database. If the table predates a column this code
expects, they say so and exit 1 rather than silently repairing it; `python
db.py` with no arguments is what adds columns.

### Then diff before importing

`python db.py --diff` is read-only and shows the field-level consequences.
It shares its parse with `import_from_excel`, so it cannot drift from the
operation it previews.

```bash
cd /opt/company_registration
.venv/bin/python db.py --diff           # defaults to the sheet path below
.venv/bin/python db.py --diff /path/to/other.xlsx
```

Real output against a seeded database:

```
  companies the sheet would create : 1
  fields it would fill in          : 2
  populated fields it would REPLACE: 2
  fields already matching          : 4
  row renumbering ('No.' only)     : 0 (cosmetic)

  new: 92000003

  Overwrites, by company. Each line replaces a value that is already set:
    92000001
      Domain Status: 'purchasing' -> 'registered'  <-- MONEY
    92000002
      Domain: 'old.uk' -> 'new.uk'  <-- MONEY

  STOP. 1 company(ies) hold an outstanding purchase claim ('purchasing')
  that this sheet would overwrite:
    92000001
  A domain may already have been bought and charged for these. Importing
  discards the record of it and allows a second purchase. Reconcile against
  Namecheap first.
```

Read it in this order:

1. **`STOP` block, if present.** A company holding a `'purchasing'` claim
   means a domain may already have been bought and charged while its
   outcome went unrecorded. Importing over it discards that record and lets
   the domain stage buy again. Reconcile against the Namecheap account
   first; do not import.
2. **Lines marked `<-- MONEY`.** `Domain`, `Domain Status`, `Domain Cost`
   and `DUNS Number`. A wrong value here costs money or re-runs a stage.
3. **Everything else under Overwrites.** The sheet replaces a value that is
   already set. Only you can tell stale from authoritative.
4. **`new` and "fields it would fill in".** These are the point of the
   exercise and are safe — nothing is lost.

Then, once it reads correctly:

```bash
.venv/bin/python db.py --import
# or: .venv/bin/python db.py --import /path/to/other.xlsx
```

And confirm afterwards that no claim was disturbed — expect the same list
you saw before the import:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c "
import db
print('outstanding purchase claims:',
      [r['Company Number'] for r in db.all_rows(use_cache=False)
       if r.get('Domain Status') == db.DOMAIN_CLAIM])"
```

## 10. Verification — each step can fail

```bash
# 1. health, without credentials
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
#    expect 200

# 2. the gate actually bites
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2/companies
#    expect 401 - if this returns 200, APP_AUTH_TOKEN is not set correctly

# 3. authenticated access works
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $APP_AUTH_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v2/companies
#    expect 200

# 4. request correlation and the money channel are live
journalctl -u company-registration -n 30 --no-pager | grep -E '\[app\]|\[money\]'
#    expect lines like: INFO [app] [a1b2c3d4] GET /health -> 200 in 1ms

# 5. a headed browser can actually start (the DUNS precondition)
DISPLAY=:99 .venv/bin/python -c "
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
with sync_playwright() as p:
    b = p.chromium.launch(headless=False); b.close(); print('headed OK')"
#    expect 'headed OK'. Without DISPLAY it raises a RuntimeError naming
#    xvfb-run, which is the preflight working as intended.

# 6. Namecheap accepts this host
.venv/bin/python check_ip.py
```

## The one risk this runbook cannot retire

Whether D&B blocks this datacenter IP is **[UNKNOWN]**. No real DUNS run has
been made from any server. `browser_stealth.py` has no proxy support, so
there is no fallback in code if it is blocked. The first real wizard DUNS
request on this box is the test. Budget for a residential proxy only once
you have evidence you need one — and note the $15 plan leaves no room for
one, so that would be an increase, not a reallocation.
