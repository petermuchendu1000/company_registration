"""User accounts, roles and the approval workflow.

The console used to be guarded by one shared secret. That is the right
shape for one operator and the wrong shape the moment a second person needs
access: a shared password cannot be revoked for one person, cannot say who
did what, and cannot be anything other than all-or-nothing.

This module owns the data. auth.py owns the request gate, admin_routes.py
owns the screens. Keeping them apart means "who may do what" is answerable
by reading one file.

Passwords are stored as werkzeug scrypt hashes (32768:8:1, 16-byte salt,
per-hash). Nothing here ever stores, logs or returns a plaintext password,
and row dictionaries handed to callers have password_hash stripped unless
asked for explicitly.

Two invariants are enforced here rather than in the UI, because a UI check
is a suggestion:

  * The last active superadmin cannot be suspended, rejected, demoted or
    deleted. Locking yourself out of your own admin panel is a one-way
    door on a box you may only reach through a console.
  * Every password change and every suspension bumps session_epoch, and
    auth.py stores that epoch in the session. Changing a password or
    suspending an account therefore invalidates that user's existing
    sessions immediately, instead of leaving a logged-in browser working
    until the cookie happens to expire.

      RLS      - with no policy, a non-exempt role sees zero rows

    Both matter here: pg_default_acl on this project grants anon
    arwdDxtm on every new table automatically, so a table created with
    RLS off would be fully readable AND writable with the project's
    public anon key.

    ENABLE, deliberately NOT FORCE. FORCE subjects the table owner to RLS
    as well, which would leave rolbypassrls as the single thing keeping
