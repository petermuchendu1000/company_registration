"""
Master pipeline orchestrator.

Stages (run in order, all idempotent):
  1. check  — verify public IP is whitelisted in Namecheap
  2. match  — match registered Namecheap domains to companies in Excel
  3. email  — create dev@domain forwarding for every company domain
  4. build  — generate brand overlays, build APK/AAB, generate all assets

Usage:
    python pipeline.py                          # Run all stages
    python pipeline.py --stage match            # Single stage
    python pipeline.py --stage build            # Build only
    python pipeline.py --company 02591663       # Build one company
    python pipeline.py --skip-build             # Regenerate assets only (no Gradle)
    python pipeline.py --stage build --artifact aab  # AAB only
